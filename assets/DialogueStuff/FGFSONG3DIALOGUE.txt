Boyfriend:
-Huh…where am I? (BFstartled)

Lexi:
-SURPRISE!!! (Lexicrowd)

Boyfriend:
-W-What do you mean “surprise?” (BFstartled)

Lexi:
-Look around! I gathered up the whole Unofficial Boyfriend Fanpage community to this very spot! (Lexiexcited)
-While you were sleeping on that sidewalk, we all came together and formed a crowd! (Lexinormal)
-Now EVERYBODY gets to meet you! (Lexipumped)

Boyfriend:
-What? You…you surrounded me in FANGIRLS? (BFprovoked)

Lexi: 
-Exactly! Isn’t it awesome? (Lexiexcited)

Boyfriend:
-Awesome? One fangirl was PLENTY! I just wanted to go home, and now you have me SURROUNDED? (BFpissed1)
-I fell asleep on COLD ASPHALT because YOU stopped me in my tracks! (BFpissed2)

Lexi:
-I uh… I didn’t realize that you would feel this way… (Lexiashamed)

Boyfriend:
-Wait a minute…WHAT DID YOU DO WITH GIRLFRIEND? (BFpissed2)

Lexi:
-She uh…went crowd surfing… (Lexilookdown)

Boyfriend:
-CROWD SURFING? If that’s true, it certainly wasn’t at her own will! (BFangrystandard)
-Girlfriend HATES people putting their hands all over her, except for MINE! (BFme)

Lexi:
-Listen, I don’t know what happened to her! She probably got lost in the crowd somewhere, but couldn’t have gone far! (Lexiguilttrip)
-I thought I was doing something nice by letting you meet up with people who care about you! (Lexiguilttrip)

Boyfriend: 
-Save the sob story for later, Lexi…we can talk about this as soon as I get Girlfriend back. (BFangrystandard)
-But in the meantime, I’d say we’re about due for a song 3, wouldn’t you? (BFangrystandard)

Lexi:
-I only came prepared to sing 2… (Lexilookdown)

Boyfriend:
-Oh, don’t worry…I’LL start this one. (BFme)
