SONG 1 DIALOGUE 

Important: each - is a different box.

Girlfriend: 
-Tonight was absolutely AWESOME. Nobody even stood a CHANCE against you! (GFcheery)

Boyfriend:
-Those people were leagues below me, though. A TRUE opponent wouldn’t have been so easy! (BFnormal)

Girlfriend:
-Oh come on, don’t act like you weren’t nervously sweating in that last battle… (GFnormal)

Boyfriend:
-Pffft, you’re scared of LIGHTNING. Cut me some slack! (BFcheery)

Girlfriend:
-Haha, you have a point. (GFnormal)
-All that aside, though… I’m absolutely pooped. (GFfrown)
-Bobbing your head back and forth endlessly is a lot more tiring than you’d think. (GFfrown)

Boyfriend:
-Yeah, I’m ready to crash early tonight. I think I’ve earned a good sleep. (BFnormal)
-Luckily there shouldn’t be anybody else to get in our way, it’s a straight shot home from here! (BFcheery)

Girlfriend: 
-Yup, absolutely no more trouble from this point forward! (GFcheery)
-Wait a minute, who’s tha- (GFfrown)

-BOYFRIEND! Is it really you? (Lexipumped)

-Do I…Know you? (BFconfused)

Lexi:
-Probably not… (Lexilookdown)
-But now you do! (Lexicheery)
-It’s an absolute pleasure to meet you after all this time! (Lexicheery)

Boyfriend:
-Hold on, you can understand me? (BFconfused)
-I was just thinking out loud. Figured all that you’d hear is “beep skiddily boop” or something. (BFfrown)

Lexi:
-Of course I can! You really think that I wouldn’t be fluent in boyfriend speak? (Lexinormal)

Boyfriend:
-I don’t know…would you? I don’t even know who you are. (BFfrown)

Lexi: 
-The names Lexi! I’m your biggest fan! (Lexicheery)
-Just ask any member of the Unofficial Boyfriend Fanpage, and they’ll tell you! (Lexinormal)

Girlfriend:
-“Biggest fan?” I didn’t know boyfriend had fans. Or a fanpage. (GFfrown)

Lexi:
-Of course he has fans! He beat your parents TWICE at their own game! (Lexipumped)
-That’s enough to get ANYBODY talking. (Lexinormal)
Boyfriend:
-Really? I thought the dearests were a cakewalk. (BFconfused)

Lexi: 
-That’s just it! You’re so skilled at funkin’ that you make light work of even the deadliest opponents! (Lexicheery)
-There are thousands of people who admire what you do… (Lexinormal)
-And I’m one of them! (Lexicheery)

Boyfriend:
-Yeah… your hat, hair and shirt made that REEEEEAL subtle. (BFupset)

Lexi:
-Was that supposed to be sarcasm? I’m not good at sarcasm. (Lexinormal)
-BUT ITS OK! All that matters is that I’m right here, next to my idol, in the flesh! (Lexipumped)

Boyfriend:
-So what’ll it be? You want me to sign something, take a selfie? (BFconfused)

Lexi: 
-Actually…uh…. (Lexilookdown)
-I was wondering if maaaaaybe we could sing a song? (Lexishrug)

Boyfriend: 
-Sorry, but I just got done singing songs with literal gods. I’m kinda burnt out on the vocal department. (BFfrown)

Girlfriend:
-Awww, come on boyfriend! She really cares about you. (GFplead)
-Just one song couldn’t hurt, right? (GFplead)

Boyfriend: 
-Alright, fine, but only because girlfriend seems so insistent on it. (BFupset)

Lexi:
-AWESOME! I promise I’ll make this worth your time! (Lexipumped)
